My name is Jane (Jingyan) Jiang, I graduated from the Master of Information Systems Management program at **Carnegie Mellon University**. I got my Bachelor of Economics degree from Xiamen University with the highest distinction. I currently work as a Predoctoral Appointee at **Argonne National Lab** focusing on data mining and machine learning.

**I am actively applying to the 2025 fall Ph.D. programs!**

Research Interests
======
My academic interests encompass **machine learning**, **data mining**, and **causal inference**, with a focus on **data-driven complex decision-making problems**. Besides, I am also interested in the Large Language Model area. 

Currently, I am studying the effect of bike-sharing station changes on shared bikes' demand and supply and the fairness of the bike-sharing system using causal approaches under the guidance of **Professor Woody Zhu**.
